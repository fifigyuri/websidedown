Welcome to a yet another blog about web development. Why should you bother reading
posts from this one? I see web development as a platform to understand different
technologies, languages or concepts. Web is still a dominating media, understanding
it has practical reasons, it can give you a way to make living. However, I find it
more practical to look at practical things playfully (..isn't playfulness the best
way how to understand things anyway..?). There is going to be only one sticking
point in the posts, and that's the Web. I will not stick to languages, technologies,..
I'm not restricting myself to pure programming topics, we can sail to post about web design
topics just as well.

I hope, you'll find this useful and a bit refreshing.. So worth of following.
